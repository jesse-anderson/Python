## Python repository for my code snippets.


### [Numerical-Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Numerical-Integration.py) <a name ="Numerical Integration">

#### Performs an integral with clear boundaries from number to number for a given function.
#
#
### [Nonlinear_Equations[Newton_Raphson]](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Nonlinear_Equations%5BNewton_Raphson%5D.py) <a name = "NonLinear Solver Using Newton Raphson method">

#### Solves a system of nonlinear equations using the Newton-Raphson method. Note the dummy V-30 equation as a check to ensure that the program is in fact working correctly.
#
#
### [Symbolic-Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Symbolic-Integration.py) <a name ="Symbolic Integration">

#### Performs a symbolic integration and handles the equations which either stump Symbolab or require a lot of computation time on Wolfram.
#
#
### [Array-Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Array-Integration.py) <a name ="Array Integration">

#### Performs an integral for a given data set using various methods(linear/spline) and also plots/interpolates the data. The interpolation used is linear, cubic, and nearest. The hope is to extend this interpolation to 3 dimensions and also include a delaunay triangulation at some point in the near future.
#
#
### [movegui](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/movegui.py) <a name ="movegui program">

#### This program is designed to replicate some of the functionality of matlab's movegui function since I found myself using it nearly every time I plotted there to quickly see all of my graphs and check if there were any glaring issues with my outputted values.
