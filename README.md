## [Cluster Analysis with GUI](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/tree/main/Cluster-Analysis-with-GUI) <a name ="Cluster Analysis">
#### A program that provides various functionalities for cluster analysis. It uses the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows the user to open an XY matrix file and perform different types of analyses on the data.

#### The program provides the following functionalities:

#### Opening an XY matrix file: The user can open a file containing X, Y, and optionally Z coordinates.
  
#### Plotting the data: The program can plot the X and Y coordinates from the opened file.
  
#### Ripley's K analysis: This analysis measures the degree of clustering between points at various radii. The program calculates Ripley's K and L values and plots them.
  
#### DBSCAN clustering: The program performs density-based spatial clustering of the XY points using the DBSCAN algorithm. It clusters points based on a search radius and minimum number of points. The resulting clusters are color-coded and plotted.
  
####  OPTICS clustering: The program performs density-based spatial clustering of the XY points using the OPTICS algorithm. It clusters points based on a search radius and minimum number of points. The resulting clusters are color-coded and plotted.
  
#### The program utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data processing, plotting, and clustering. It also includes functionalities to check file sizes, create folders for storing results, and display information messages in the GUI.
  
### [Numerical Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Numerical-Integration.py) <a name ="Numerical Integration">

#### Performs an integral with clear boundaries from number to number for a given function.

## [Nonlinear_Equations[Newton_Raphson]](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Nonlinear_Equations%5BNewton_Raphson%5D.py) <a name = "NonLinear Solver Using Newton Raphson method">

#### Solves a system of nonlinear equations using the Newton-Raphson method. Note the dummy V-30 equation as a check to ensure that the program is in fact working correctly.
#
## [Symbolic-Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Symbolic-Integration.py) <a name ="Symbolic Integration">

#### Performs a symbolic integration and handles the equations which either stump Symbolab or require a lot of computation time on Wolfram.
#
## [Array-Integration](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/Array-Integration.py) <a name ="Array Integration">

#### Performs an integral for a given data set using various methods(linear/spline) and also plots/interpolates the data. The interpolation used is linear, cubic, and nearest. The hope is to extend this interpolation to 3 dimensions and also include a delaunay triangulation at some point in the near future.
#
## [movegui](https://github.com/jesse-anderson/Python/blob/main/movegui.py) <a name ="movegui program">

#### This program is designed to replicate some of the functionality of matlab's movegui function since I found myself using it nearly every time I plotted there to quickly see all of my graphs and check if there were any glaring issues with my outputted values.
